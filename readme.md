# Minigamers - CEN 3031 Project 

_Alpha v.1.1_

A program that features different type of mini games. Games featured in this version:
* Hangman
* Breakout

## Description

This project compiles three popular minigames: Tic-Tac-Toe, Hangman, and Dodger, into a short series for a quick & fun play session. We've used C++ & the SFML visual library to achieve this. By using the agile development cycle, the team has devised a system to use good programing practices by using comments effectivly and efficiently within the C++ code of this project.


## Getting Started 

* Import the C++ Code into an IDE with a C++ Complier (we used CLion).
* Once files are imported, run the code. A console should pop-up featuring a menu. 
*In the menu, using the arrow keys, navigate to what option you want.
** Hangman - a game in which one player tries to guess the letters of a word, and failed attempts are recorded.
** Breakout - a game that contains a layer of bricks represented by lines the top and the goal is to destroy them all by repeatedly bouncing a ball off a paddle into them.

### Dependencies

* C++ Compiler




### Installing

Windows:  
- Install the files in your preferred IDE, along with SFML if not already installed to handle local dependencies
- Alter the CMAKE.txt file to point to your directory & project name
- Run the minigame  

Mac:
- Install the files into your IDE, along with SFML libraries
- ***If m1 mac** -* Alter the CMAKE to change x64 to x86 compile  
- Run the minigame
